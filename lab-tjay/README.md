#Lab-06-TCP-Client by T.Jay

To start with:

* Initialized ReadMe
* Then, created eslintrc, eslintignore, gitignore
* Initialized package.json
* Installed Dev Dependencies: Mocha and expect
* Etc, etc... You know what we do in the beginning :)

* I just went straight to the docs on this one - reading everything I can on how to set this up and quickly went to basic testing for my client. Just to see if I can get a name and socket out of it... Done.

* I went and made the simplest of constructors in client.js, just to get the job done.

* Utilizing what I could learn from the lecture and demos - I built a rudimentary server in index.js and started up by firing it up.

* more to come

* Had an issue with Git - because, git.

* Sweet Jesus - it works.
