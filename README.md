In my module simpleServer.js it constructs the function Client which takes in a socket and assigns a socket, socket id, and socket nickname. Then in my module for the event of a disconnected socket it takes in a socket and a callback. It then assigns the clientPool as an array of sockets. Then on the event of a socket event it takes out the socket from the socketPool when it is called in index.js. Then on index.js it creates a server and requires all the necessary files to construct one. Then a event action is called on the socket to start a new connection and assign a socket to each connection. Then on the event of data is entered to the server it writes to the whole server. Then it goes through some logic and says if the data starts with /something do that action. It also contains an event that handles errors and logs them to console.
